OpenIO SDS offer a full set of data management features which are designed
for the best efficiency and performance while keeping a low $/GB thanks
to the ability to store and move data to the best suited media for each
single workload. A particular focus is on data lifecycle management and its
automation , allowing end users to ease application development and simplify
storage management.

Storage pools
-------------
Groups of storage media, hard disks or SSDs, can be configured to isolate
particular traffic or objects from others. Data can be moved from one pool
to another with simple operations or through automated tasks, enabling
automated tiering. This improves multi-tenancy, performance consistency,
and eases the organization of data across different media pools.

Automated tiering
-----------------
With storage tiering, it is possible to configure classes of hardware, and
select a specific one when needed to store data. This mechanism is called
a storage policy. For example, a pool of high performance disks (like SSDs)
can be configured in a special class to store objects that require low latency
access. Several storage policies can be configured for the same namespace. They
can be associated with specific hardware, but also with old or new objects,
with a specific data protection mechanism for a particular dataset, etc.

.. Hybrid cloud support
.. --------------------

Dynamic storage policies
------------------------
Storage policies are OpenIO’s way of managing storage tiering. They consist
of triplets describing constraints set by the requestor:

- which storage class is to be used (the kind of device with its fallback,
  i.e., fast SSD, SAS drive, tape, etc.);
- how data is to be protected (simple replication or sophisticated erasure
  encoding);
- whether data is to be processed (compressed, encrypted, etc.).

All possible storage policies are namespace-wide, with default configurations
that can be changed on the fly. These defaults can be overridden on a
per-container basis.

Data protection is flexible, starting from a simple, multiple-copy mechanism,
up to erasure coding, allowing users to chose the appropriate option for
their needs, both in terms of protection and efficiency.

Dynamic data protection policies are also available. They allow the system
to automatically select the best data protection mechanism after looking
at the characteristics of the stored object, associating optimal efficiency
and data protection for each object stored in the system.

OpenIO designed a dynamic data protection mechanism that automatically selects
the best data protection mechanism according to the characteristics of the
stored object, thus combining optimal efficiency and data protection. It is
thus possible to have several storage policies for each domain / user / bucket,
then to assign rules to apply these policies, e.g. depending on the size of the
object to be stored.

In a context where we do not know the type of file to store, the use of the
dynamic data protection mechanism implemented by OpenIO is therefore recommended.

As an example, both `x3` replication and `14+4` erasure coding can be assigned
for a new bucket, with the rule that files smaller than 128KiB are replicated,
while larger files use erasure coding.

As an illustration, for an 8 KB object, we obtain:

- 3 copies: a total capacity of 8 * 3 = 24KB but only 3 IOPS.
- EC 14 + 4 (considering a piece of 8Ko): 8 * 18 = 72KB and 18 IOPS.
  In this case, a multiple data protection policy is not only better in terms
  of performance, but also in terms of capacity consumption.

For an 8 MB file, you get:

- 3 copies: a total capacity of 8 * 3 = 24 MB
- EC 14 + 4: the total capacity is approximately 10.2 MB
  In this case, no matter what the IOPS are, it’s really clear that erasure
  coding saves a lot of stockage space.

Data Compression
----------------
Applied to chunks of data, this reduces overall storage cost. Decompression
is made live during chunk download, with an acceptable extra latency and
CPU usage. Compression is usually an asynchronous job to avoid hurting
performance, and you can specify which data you want to compress (data ages,
mime-types, users…).

S3 Lifecycle compliance
-----------------------
OpenIO SDS supports S3 object life-cycle management, allowing end users to set
up time-based rules and trigger actions accordingly.

Automations can be set to move, compress, delete data by age, last modified
date and many other characteristics, improving system efficiency and data
placement for best performance and capacity utilization.

No SPOF architecture
--------------------
Every service used to serve data is redundant. From the top level of
the directory to the chunk of data stored on disk, all information is
duplicated. There is no SPOF (single point of failure): a node can be shut
down, and it will not affect overall integrity or availability.

Replication and Erasure Coding
------------------------------
Configurable at each level of the architecture, directory replication
secures namespace integrity. The service directory and metadata containers
can be synchronously replicated to other nodes. Data can be protected and
replicated in various manners, from simple replication that just creates
multiple copies of data, to erasure coding, or even distributed erasure
coding. This allows the user to choose the best compromise between data
availability and durability, storage efficiency, and cost.

Versioning
----------
A container can keep several versions of an object. This is configured at
the container-level, for all the objects at once. The setting is set at the
container’s creation. It may be activated during the container’s life. If
no value is specified, the namespace default value is considered. When
versioning is disabled, pushing a new version of an object overrides the
former version, and deleting an object marks it for removal. When versioning
is enabled, pushing an object creates a new version of the object. Previous
versions of an object can be listed and restored. The semantics of objects
versioning has been designed to be compliant with both Amazon S3 and Swift
APIs.

Container snapshots
-------------------
OpenIO SDS provides tools to make container snapshots.
The new container is built by duplicating meta data and links to the original data chunks at the moment of snapshot creation.
Practically you can create a new container, starting from an existing one, which points to the same data chunks as the original container. Every operation performed on the new container do not affect original data but creates new objects or data chunks for their updated parts. 
Snapshots are synchronous operations, during which the container is in readonly mode.

Data integrity checks
---------------------
Integrity checks are performed periodically to ensure that no silent data
corruption or loss occurs.

Geo-Redundancy
--------------
OpenIO SDS allows storage policies and data to be distributed across
multiple datacenters. Depending on distance and latency requirements, data
storage clusters can be stretched over multiple locations synchronously,
or replicated to a different site asynchronously.
