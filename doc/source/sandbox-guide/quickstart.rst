OpenIO SDS is a scalable open-source object storage solution.
It is compatible with Amazon S3 and OpenStack Swift.
Using OpenIO SDS one can easily scale its storage from a few-terabyte cluster to a multi-petabyte platform.
OpenIO SDS is hardware-agnostic and can be installed on both x86 and ARM hardware.
